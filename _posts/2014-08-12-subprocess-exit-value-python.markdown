os.system doesnâ€™t return the exit code directly but a tuple containing its pid and exit status indication: a 16-bit number, whose low byte is the signal number that killed the process, and whose high byte is the exit status (if the signal number is zero); the high bit of the low byte is set if a core file was produced.

So that means you have to do the following:

{% highlight python %}
tuple = os.system("your_command");
exit_code = tuple >> 8
{% endhighlight %}
