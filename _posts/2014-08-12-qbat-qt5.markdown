I just finished to setup a new system and I found out that I still have ‘qt4′ package for only one application : ‘qbat’.

qbat is a small tool based on qt4 to display battery stats in system tray, it’s small, lightweight and useful. I like it so I updated it for qt5 and here are the links :

 * [AUR package]
 * [qbat on github]

Or if you’re on Arch Linux just type :

    yaourt -S qbat-qt5

[AUR package]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qbat-qt5/
[qbat on github]: https://github.com/gogoprog/qbat
