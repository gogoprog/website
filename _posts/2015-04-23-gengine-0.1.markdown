It is finally time to start releasing the engine I started a year ago:

 * [http://gengine.net](The main website gengine.net)
 * [https://github.com/gogoprog/gengine](The github repository)

What is gengine?

 * A 2d game engine with Lua scripting
 * No visual editor, text only
 * Entities and components system
 * Aimed for fast development, good for gamejams or prototypes
 * UI is pure HTML5
 * Linux and Windows support
 * Can be compiled to HTML5 through emscripten

Feel free to contact me for any questions, please use github for issues!
