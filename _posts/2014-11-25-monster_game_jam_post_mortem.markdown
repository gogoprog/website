Last week-end was the time for the first gamejam organized in Brussels.
So I had to be there! Here is a small post-mortem about this jam:

First of all I must say that it was probably the best I ever participated.
The environment was very nice, the food was good, lot of space for everybody, comfy sofas and chairs, no wired connections but the WiFi was fine, multiplugs everywhere, etc.

There also was a wide green space outside, perfect for brainstorms, oxygen refill and nature connection.

I made a team with David Boulard, Guillaume Culot and Arnaud Theiss.

The theme was 'Inner Mechanism' which was great because it can lead to anything without being not meta-understandable.

The fact I spoke about nature connection is linked to our game : Redneck Galaxy!

The idea was that you are two farmers in Space trying to plant potatoes on fertile comets, preventing slugs from detroying your fields.
One player will be in the space-tractor and the other one inside the tractor, controlling the inner-mechanisms. (activate engines, upgrade weapons, repair ship, etc.)

Of course it derived a little bit so we skipped the planting part and just kept slugs slaughter and resources gathering.
It is a cooperative split-screen multiplayer game mixing a pacman-like to refill weapons or shield and a top-down shooter to kill the slugs.

You can clearly see the 2 parts here :

This game jam was also the first real test case for my personal engine, and it went quite good! More about this in a few weeks (or months?)

My last words will be a big thanks to [@andreadst] for having successfuly organized this event!
